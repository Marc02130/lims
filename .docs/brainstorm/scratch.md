Questions

Compliance Requirements:
Are you targeting specific standards (e.g., FDA 21 CFR Part 11, HIPAA, GDPR) for audit trails, data encryption, or session management?
audit trails, data encryption and session management are in scope

Should user actions (e.g., signup, login, permission changes) be logged in PostgreSQL for audit purposes?
yes

User Approval Workflow:
How will admins be notified of pending user approvals (e.g., email, in-app notifications)?
in app notification

Should there be a time limit for unapproved accounts (e.g., auto-delete after 7 days)?
no

Roles and Groups:
What specific roles do you envision (e.g., Admin, Lab Technician, Researcher)?
Admin, Analyst, Manager, Read-Only for now

What groups will control data access (e.g., by lab, project, or department)?
project and lab

Should users belong to multiple groups or roles?
yes

Data Security:
Should group-based security apply to specific database records (e.g., samples, experiments) in PostgreSQL or MongoDB?
yes

Do you need row-level security (RLS) in PostgreSQL for fine-grained data access?
yes

Frontend Integration:
How will the React frontend handle login/signup (e.g., forms, OAuth2 flow)?
login form (email, password - role drop down based on email). with sign up and forgot password button. sign up requires email verification first and last name

Should the frontend display role/group-specific UI (e.g., hide admin features for non-admins)?
role

Scalability and Performance:
How many concurrent users do you expect (e.g., small lab vs. enterprise)?
10
Should sessions use refresh tokens or short-lived JWTs for security?
yes

External Authentication:
Do you plan to integrate with external identity providers (e.g., LDAP, OAuth2 via Auth0, Okta) for labs with existing SSO systems?
it should have the capability

Error Handling and UX:
What feedback should users receive during signup/login (e.g., “Awaiting admin approval”)?
awaiting admin approval after email verification

How should invalid login attempts be handled (e.g., lockout after 5 failures)?
5 failures -> lock

Suggestions- these are good suggestions

Audit Logging: Log all authentication/authorization events (e.g., login, signup, role changes) in PostgreSQL to meet compliance needs, complementing NGINX’s request logs.
Email Verification: Require email verification during signup to prevent spam accounts, common in regulated environments.
Admin Dashboard: Build a React admin panel for approving users, assigning roles/groups, and viewing audit logs.
Refresh Tokens: Use refresh tokens with short-lived JWTs to balance security and user experience, especially for long lab sessions.
Row-Level Security (RLS): Implement PostgreSQL RLS for group-based data access (e.g., users only see samples from their lab group).
Session Management: Store active sessions in PostgreSQL or Redis for revocation (e.g., admin can terminate a user’s session).
Rate Limiting: Enhance slowapi==0.1.9 and NGINX rate limiting for login/signup endpoints to prevent brute-force attacks.
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Consider adding MFA for sensitive roles (e.g., admins) to meet stringent security standards.
Group Hierarchies: Allow nested groups (e.g., “Lab A > Project X”) for complex data access control.
Error Messages: Provide user-friendly messages (e.g., “Your account is pending approval”) and log detailed errors for admins.
